# Expression Change: Unity Application

This repository represents the Unity implementation of the extension application for expression change. It is to be used in conjunction with the Python backend code found [here](https://github.com/RaymondGuo2/FacialExpressionApplication/tree/e48c3274843d1ed22deec193e4760ca1fbe52620). 

Since there was trouble uploading all of the Unity files into the repository, the main C# scripts are provided for reference, along with the default head mesh that was used. This project will be in continuous development, hoping to deploy an interactive viewer that can be viewed soon.
